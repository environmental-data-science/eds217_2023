    "Jupyter notebooks are a very common approach for working in python data science. They have many of the same advantages as `Rmd` files, and can be exported into `.pdf`, `.html`, and even into pure python files (`.py`). While most IDEs can work with notebook files, the jupyter notebook server will always have the greatest amount of functionality and access to extensions that enhance the notebook experience (e.g. the [`RISE`](https://rise.readthedocs.io) extension, which powers this class's lecture slideshows)\n"

For now, the important point to notice is the text at the far right of the toolbar. It should say `eds217_2023`. This is the name of the kernel that is running your notebook.

    "\n",
    "You can add a cell to a notebook by clicking the \"+\" button in the toolbar. This will add a cell below the currently selected cell. \n",

    "\n",
    "You can delete a cell by clicking the scissors button in the toolbar. This will delete the currently selected cell. There is also a trashcan icon in the cell toolbar that will delete the cell. Finally, you can also use the keyboard shortcut `D,D` (press `D` twice).\n",
