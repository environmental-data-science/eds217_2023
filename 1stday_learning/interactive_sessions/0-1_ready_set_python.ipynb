    "\n",
    "1. A system for managing computing environments to ensure that code runs in a consistent environment.\n",
    "1. A system for managing python packages to ensure that code runs with consistent dependencies.\n",
    "1. A system for managing python code, which is usually an integrated development environment (IDE) in which editing and running code occur interactively.\n"

    "In the past, these three components were often managed separately, but in recent years, there has been a trend towards integrating these components into a single system. For example, the [RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com) is a single system that manages all three components for R code. Similarly, the [Data Spell IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/) is a single system that manages all three components for python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will use a combination of tools to manage these three components. We will use `conda` to manage computing environments and python packages, and we will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as our IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are both very popular tools in the python data science community, and they are both free and open source. However, there are many other options for managing computing environments, python packages, and code execution. We will discuss some of these options below, or you can skip ahead to the [instructions](#instructions) for setting up your local machine.\n"

    "## Managing Computing Environments, Libraries, and Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many options for managing computing environments. These days, a common method is to use `containers`, in which an entire computational system (including processes, memory, disk space) is spun up as an isolated service on your local (or remote) machine. Tools such as [docker](https://www.docker.com) or python-specific [shiv](https://shiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allow for isolated packaging and execution of python programs. Generally, these are better-suited for deployment of code on remote servers, but they can be used locally too. In this class, we're not going to use containers. Instead we will use a more traditional approach to managing computing environments and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "More traditional approaches to managing computing environments and/or packages and dependencies include a suite of diverse tools. Some of these focus only on managing computing environments, while others focus on managing python packages. Some are designed to work with python only (e.g `venv`, `conda`), while others are designed to work with any programming language (e.g `virtualenv`). A few of the most popular options in each category are listed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package management tools for python\n",
    "`pip` is the standard package management tool for python. It is included with the standard python distribution, and it is the most widely used package management tool for python. However, it does not manage computing environments, so it is not as widely used as other tools below.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pipx` is a tool developed by [Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca) that is designed to manage python packages. It has the advantage of being able to install any package hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org), as well as packages hosted on github and even packages you‚Äôve made on your local machine. However, it does not manage computing environments, and it does not manage package dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment management tools for python \n",
    "`virtualenv` is a is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the `venv`. While `venv` is sufficient to create virtual environments, it does not manage package dependencies, so it is also not as widely used as other tools below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools that manage both environments and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` is a tool developed by [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) that is designed to manage computing environments. However, it also allows you to install packages, and even install binaries of packages directly without the need for local compilation. It also manages package dependencies, ensuring libraries are inter-operable.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mamba` is a new tool developed by the [QuantStack](https://quantstack.net) team that is designed to be a drop-in replacement for `conda`. It allows you to create new environments, install packages, and even install binaries of packages directly without the need for local compilation. It also manages package dependencies, ensuring libraries are inter-operable. It is designed to be faster than `conda` and to use fewer resources. It is also designed to be more compatible with `pip` than `conda`. However, it is not as widely used as `conda` and it is not as well-supported by IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "`poetry` is another new tool developed by the [Python Packaging Authority](https://python-poetry.org) team that is designed to manage computing environments and python packages. Advantages of `poetry` include a simplified approach to dependency management and a simplified approach to building and packaging your own code for distribution. Disadvantages include a lack of support for `conda` environments and a lack of support for `pip` packages that are not hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) (although this may change in the future).\n"
