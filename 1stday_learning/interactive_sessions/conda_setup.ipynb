The first step for intializing `conda` is to determine which shell (command line) your system uses. The process is different for each operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying your shell on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, if you're using the Command Prompt, your shell is `cmd`. If you're using the newer Windows Terminal or PowerShell (you probably will be), it's `powershell`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you've set up something like Git Bash, Cygwin, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), then you might be using `bash` or another shell.\n",

    "### Identifying your shell on a Mac\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "    conda create -n my_py310_environment python=3.10\n",

    "Finally, you probably noticed that `conda` prompts you for permission before installing new packages. Sometimes you need to pay attention to these prompts, especially when you are adding packages to very complex environments. But on creation, you may want to speed things up. The `--yes` flag allows you to bypass approval and go straight to installation:\n",

    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",

    "In order to make sure our python environment is used when running code within an interactive editor such as a Jupyter notebook or in an IDE, you need ensure that the correct kernel is used to run our code. A python kernel is a program that runs and introspects the user's code. Interactive tools such as Jupyter and IDEs use the kernel to execute code when you run a cell in the editor. `ipykernel`` is a tool that allows you to use specific python kernels when running code interactively within Jupyter notebooks and IDEs.\n",

    "After activating the `eds217_2023` environment, run the following command:\n",
